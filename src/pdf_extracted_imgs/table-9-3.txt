### Summary of the Markdown Table

**Subject and Purpose:**
The table compares various methods for evaluating performance in natural language processing and other related tasks. It includes representative and state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, as well as results from the authors' own experimental runs.

**Key Numeric Trends and Comparisons:**
- The highest average score is achieved by the method "LLLaVA+GPT-4† (judge)" with an average of **92.53**.
- Among representative methods, "Human" scores a high average of **88.40**, while "GPT-3.5" shows lower performance with an average of **73.97**.
- The method "MM-CoTLarge" exhibits a strong performance with scores like **95.91** in the LAN category and **92.89** for context modality (NO).
- Notable outlier performance includes "MM-CoTBase", which has a significantly lower score in the SOC category (**77.17**) compared to others.

**Domain or Context:**
The context of this table falls within the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly focusing on natural language understanding, processing, and evaluation metrics across different models.

**Insights for Future Search Queries:**
- Keywords to consider for future queries include "NAT," "SOC," "LAN," "Context Modality," and "SoTA methods."
- The performance of models can be evaluated based on specific categories like "TXT," "IMG," and "NO," which may help refine searches related to context-specific applications.
- Users may want to look for comparisons involving human performance versus AI models in language tasks, as well as the impact of different architectures like "GPT" and "LLLaVA" on outcomes.
